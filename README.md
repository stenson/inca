INCA
=================

Inca is a fantastically simple and straightfoward tool for developing web apps and sites with Mustache.


Usage
-----

To use Inca, you must have Node installed. When installed, clone or download the repo. In Terminal, start the server by typing:

```
node inca-tern.js
```

And that will open the default file, `index.html` in your default browser. **Boom!**


Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backwards compatibility, Inca will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch
